This is (or should be) a full JavaScript interop package using package:js bindings.  
The bindings are generated by machine-reading WebIDL files for types and MDN website for documentation.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:js_bindings/js_bindings.dart';

void main() {
  var div = document.createElement('div')
    ..innerHTML = 'Hello world =]';
  
  document.body.appendChild(div);
}
```

## Promise and Future

JS Promises and Dart Futures are not the same thing.  
This package addes an easy way to use promises:

```dart
import 'package:js_bindings/bindings/orientation_event.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final permission = await DeviceOrientationEvent.requestPermission().future;
  
  print('Granted? ${permission == PermissionState.granted}');
}
```

## What to import

There is a folder called *bindings* and there is one dart file for each IDL spec.  
For example, to use ```MediaStream```:


```dart
import 'package:js_bindings/bindings/mediacapture_streams.dart';

void main() {
  var div = document.createElement('div')
    ..innerHTML = 'Hello world =]';
  
  document.body.appendChild(div);
}
```
