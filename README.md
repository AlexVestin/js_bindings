This is (or should be) a full JavaScript interop package using package:js bindings.

The bindings are generated by machine-reading WebIDL files for types and MDN website for documentation.

Take a look at [MediaStream](https://github.com/jodinathan/js_bindings/blob/main/lib/bindings/mediacapture_streams.dart) file and check out how nice it got with the awesome MDN documentation.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:js_bindings/js_bindings.dart';

void main() {
  var div = document.createElement('div')
    ..innerHTML = 'Hello world =]';
  
  document.body!.appendChild(div);
}
```

Check the example tab for a more complete example.

## Promise and Future

JS Promises and Dart Futures are not the same thing.  
But this package make them the same! :D

```dart
import 'package:js_bindings/js_bindings.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // you can await like regular future
  await window.navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia();
  // or 
  window.navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia().then((event) {});
}
```
