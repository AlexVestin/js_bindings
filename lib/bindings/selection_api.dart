///  A object represents the range of text selected by the user or
/// the current position of the caret. To obtain a object for
/// examination or manipulation, call [window.getSelection()].
///  A user may make a selection from left to right (in document
/// order) or right to left (reverse of document order). The anchor
/// is where the user began the selection and the focus is where the
/// user ends the selection. If you make a selection with a desktop
/// mouse, the anchor is placed where you pressed the mouse button,
/// and the focus is placed where you released the mouse button.
///
///   Note: Anchor and focus should not be confused with the start
/// and end positions of a selection. The anchor can be placed before
/// the focus or vice-versa, depending on the direction you made your
/// selection.
